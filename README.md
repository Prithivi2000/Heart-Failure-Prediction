# Heart-Failure-Prediction
The target variable has two classes 1 and 0, where 1 is less in number. So, SMOTE analysis is used to equalize the number of 1 and 0. The model uses Artificial Neural Network Classifier which will predict if Heart Failure will occur or not depending on Age , Anaemia, creatinine phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelets, serum creatinine, serum sodium, gender, smoking, time since having High BP.
